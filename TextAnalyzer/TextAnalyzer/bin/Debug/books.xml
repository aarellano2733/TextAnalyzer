    <p> Emmylou's life has been a short but impactful one thus far. She is the pride and joy of our little family, and has been a star in all of her education.  She is working on her "high school" diploma.  This is her advanced class training through a pet store which shall not be named.  She will continue on and receive her training as a Therapy dog, and I am sure she will shine in that as well.  She brings joy to all who see her, and even more to those who meet her.  She is able to bring a smile to those all around her. She works hard to master her training with her father "me" and her mother.  Her story is just beginning, and will continue to flourish.
